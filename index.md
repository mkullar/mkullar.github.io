## About Me

My research skills cover how we can personalize analysis to better understand behavior and motivations through innovative data-based insights. I am adept at defining research strategy and leading end-to-end research that can systematically address complex problem spaces. Much of my work has been focused on ways to improve people's well-being and mental health, but I've also worked on a variety of research strategies in areas ranging from fintech, gaming, sustainability, and even music perception.

My work has been funded by research foundations stemming from executive leadership at Microsoft & Google. I am _very_ passionate about making real-world impact with research informing decision-making and strategy.
